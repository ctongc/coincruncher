#INTRODUCTION
This app, Coin Cruncher, is our final project of CSE 438S. We built this game based on the nostalgia of pixel arcade games in the 90s. There were lots of 2D games in our childhood, Super Mario Bro, Pacman, to name just a few. Coin Cruncher is also an old-fashion style game for the people who grown through the early 90s.

#REQUIREMENT
The Coin Cruncher is built on Xode 8.1 for iOS 10.1.
